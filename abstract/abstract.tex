{\large\textbf{Abstract:}} Intelligent systems are more and more integrated into human environement. We need to communicate with them in a way that we do not have to always comply to the use of a predefine interface that may be boring blabla. We study the particular problem of calibration. We first show that human are capable to solve this problem and derive from their behavior an algorithm that allow to interact with a machine without specifing in advance the specific signal required. We show that this performs better than a calibration procedure. We show that we can derive a planning strategy for such a system that takes into account the uncertainty on both the signal and the task space.

This work opens new perspective in the way we could interact with intelligent machine in a seamless and transparent manner. blabla\\
