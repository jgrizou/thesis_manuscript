% It was all about people providing me with the opportunity to learn.

First of all, I would like to thank Pierre-Yves Oudeyer and Manuel Lopes for supervising me during this three years. 

And especially for giving me the opportunity to simply be in the lab, listening and taking part in various scientific and philosophical discussions.

I am grateful to Dr. Charles Capaday, Dr. Ram\'{o}n Huerta and Prof. Auke Jan Ijspeert for providing me with the early opportunity to discover research in their respective labs. Without them, I would never have pursued doctoral studies.

During these three years, I had the chance to engage in different collaborative works. I thank I{\~n}aki Iturrate and Luis Montesano for their numerous advises and their infinite patience. I thank Anna-Lisa Vollmer and Katharina J. Rohlfing for their invaluable insight on the implication of this work to human behavioral understanding. I thank Peter Stone and Samuel Barrett for their enthusiasm and for providing me the opportunity to visit the LARG lab.

I thanks the jury members 

Unlimited thanks to my family for the good start in life they gave me, my friends for they unique ability to make me laugh, and Sara Maubourguet for her support all along these three years.

Numerous thanks go to all the members of the \textsc{FLOWERS} team for contributing in making these three years a memorable experience.
