The purpose of this manuscript is to explain a problem and to provide an intuition on how to solve this problem. While reading, you will be introduced to the most important aspects of the work by simple, hopefully intuitive, visualization of the problem and of the specific properties we exploit. My aim is therefore to endow the interested readers to implement their own version of the algorithm with the tools they are more familiar with.
