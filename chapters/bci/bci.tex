With I\~naki Iturrate and Luis Montesano.

Context - Why now: We have a working algorithm, in simulation or with pretty god data

Need - Why the reader: we want to test it on a realistic setup with signal which make sense to use in tis context, BCI seems a promising direction

Task - Why us: Together with I\~naki Iturrate and Luis Montesano we adapted the algorithm to work with EEG signal on a grid world setup.

Object- Why this chapter:  We present first the EEG paradigm and related work in the domain. Then show simulated experiment using prerecorded data, and finally show some run with some real users.

Findings - What: It works online, with naive subject, and without pre-calibration, but the performance are no the same than in simulation

Conclusions - So what: We can hope to release this algorithm in the real word and make it useful to use. EEG are among the hardest signal to classify, if we can do it with them, we sure can do it with other king of signals.

Perspectives - What now: That are only toy problem, discrete state, discrete action, where should we go next? What are the current limitation?
