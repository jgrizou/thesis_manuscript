\chapter{Limitations, Extensions and Derivatives}
\label{chapter:limitations}
\minitoc

In the previous chapters, we described an algorithm that allow a robot to learn a new task by interacting with a human partners without defining in advance how the signals of the user maps to the meaning used by the learning agent. We tested this algorithm on two domains, a pick and place scenario using speech commands, and a reaching task scenario using EEG signals. We demonstrated the use of our system online and with real subjects using their brain to assess agent's action with respect to a final desired position.

However a number of assumptions and constraints have been defined. In this chapter we will detail a number of those limitations, discuss the possibility to overcome them and provide small experiments to demonstrate our ideas. 

In section~\ref{chapter:limitiations:simplevsmatching} we compare the performance of Equation~\ref{eq:matchingfilter} and Equation~\ref{eq:matchingfiltercrossvalidation} defined in chapter~\ref{chapter:lfui}. We show that corrrecting the classifier prediction given our knowledge about one classifier (Equation~\ref{eq:matchingfiltercrossvalidation}) makes our algortihm more robust than relying on the raw classifier outputs (Equation~\ref{eq:matchingfilter}).

In section~\ref{chapter:limitations:wordlproperties}, we present preliminary studies on how different properties of the world impacts the efficiency of several planning methods. We specifically study the impact of the size and the maze like properties. This study will highlight the fact that our uncertainty based planning method allow to identify the correct task with best performance in a few types of problems. However we will see that, by not considering the performance on the task itself during the exploration, for some problems our method lacks of efficiency with respect to solving the task as fast as possible.

In section~\ref{chapter:limitations:overlap} we introduce an other method to identify the first target based on models overlap, we present online results with real subjects in a BCI scenario, and show the limitation of this new method to identifying a sequence of multiple tasks.

In section~\ref{chapter:limitations:framegeneric} we insist again on the fact that an interaction frame is not limited to the straightforward meaning correspond we assumed (feedback and guidance), and do not requires the robot to know how to perform a task.

In section~\ref{chapter:limitations:continousstate}, we address the problem of continuous state space, and show that our method is not impacted by the continuous aspect of the problem. Indeed, as our method, when considering a simple frame, only requires to known the policy for each task, we can rely on any algorithm that computes a policy for continuous states given a pre-defined task.

In section~\ref{chapter:limitations:continoushypothesis}, we release the assumption of a finite set of task and rely on a particle filter based method to dynamically update a finite set of hypothesis. We show that sampling actively the new task, as well as selecting actively the next visited state, significantly improves the final performance of our method.

In section~\ref{chapter:limitations:framehypothesis}, we release the assumption that the interaction frame is known and consider the agent as access to a finite number of hypothetic interaction frames. We illustrated this problem in a simple scenario line world scenario. And present results from simulated experiments that demonstrate the ability our method to not only learn the task and the signal to meaning mapping, but also the interaction protocol used by the teacher.

In section~\ref{chapter:limitations:userstudies}, we discuss the need for conducting user studies in more complex domain to evaluate the scalability, efficiency, and acceptability of our method.

In section~\ref{chapter:limitations:proof}, we pinpoint the importance of understanding the properties of our algorithm, and to be able to have some certitude about its convergence and accuracy properties; and we propose a minimalist proof of for our algortihm.

Finally in section~\ref{chapter:limitations:discussion}, we discuss a number of limitations that were not addressed in this work and that are not straightforward to solve given our context. Such as using continuous actions or learning new meanings.

\section{Discussion}
\label{chapter:limitations:discussion}

Similarly, the system assumed a pre-defined repertoire of possible meanings to be associated with continuous instruction signals. Extending the system towards the creation of novel meanings is an important question. Another approach, for both extending task and meaning repertoires dynamically, would be to allow the user to teach the robot new macro-actions, associated to new macro-instructions, or macro-state, for example based on the options framework \cite{sutton1999between}.

The space of tasks to be sampled at a given moment may also be constrained by the current situation and context (for example, a robot hearing the instructions of a human while he is looking at cubes on a table may infer that the task has a higher probability to be defined in terms of manipulation of these cubes than to change the state of an object in another room). 

last limitations section: how to learn the interaction hypothesis and interaction frame is a big problem, refer to thomas thesis. (model of the world, strong restriction on the possible task, information about the interaction protocol, how to interpret a signal with respect to a task, and even how to measure its confidence.)
