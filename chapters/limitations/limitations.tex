\blfootnote{Code for most experiments presented in this chapter is available online under the github account \url{https://github.com/jgrizou/} in the following repositories: \href{https://github.com/jgrizou/lfui.git}{lfui}, \href{https://github.com/jgrizou/experiments_thesis.git}{experiments\_thesis}, and \href{https://github.com/jgrizou/datasets.git}{datasets}.}

In the previous chapters, we described an algorithm allowing a robot to learn the task desired by a user without defining in advance how the signals of the user maps with their meanings. We tested this algorithm on two domains, a pick and place scenario using speech commands, and a virtual cursor navigation task using EEG signals. We demonstrated the use of our system in real time and with real subjects using their brain to assess agent's actions with respect to a final desired position.

A number of assumptions and constraints were used. In this chapter we will detail important limitations, discuss the possibility to release them and provide small experiments to demonstrate our ideas. 

In section~\ref{chapter:limitiations:simplevsmatching} we compare the performance of Equation~\ref{eq:matchingfilter} and Equation~\ref{eq:matchingfiltercrossvalidation} defined in chapter~\ref{chapter:lfui}. We show that correcting classifiers' predictions given our knowledge about their confusion matrix (Equation~\ref{eq:matchingfiltercrossvalidation}) makes our algorithm more robust than relying on the raw classifiers' outputs (Equation~\ref{eq:matchingfilter}).

In section~\ref{chapter:limitations:wordlproperties}, we present a small study on how different properties of the world impacts the efficiency of several planning methods. We specifically study the impact of the size and the maze like properties of our environment. This study will highlight the fact that our uncertainty based planning method allows to identify the correct task with best performance in several types of problems. However we will see that, by not considering the performance on the task itself during the exploration, for some problems our method lacks of efficiency with respect to solving the task as fast as possible.

In section~\ref{chapter:limitations:overlap} we introduce another method to identify the first task based on the overlap of signal models. We present online results with real subjects in a BCI scenario, and show the limitation of this new method to identifying a sequence of multiple tasks\footnote{The work presented in section~\ref{chapter:limitations:overlap} has been published in \cite{grizou2014calibration}. It is the result of a collaboration with I{\~n}aki Iturrate and Luis Montesano.}.

In section~\ref{chapter:limitations:continousstate}, we address the problem of continuous state space, and show that our method is not impacted by the continuous aspect of the problem. Indeed, as our method only requires to known the optimal policy for each task, we can rely on any algorithm that computes a policy for continuous states given a pre-defined task.

In section~\ref{chapter:limitations:continuoushypothesis}, we release the assumption that a finite set of tasks is available and rely on a particle filter based method to dynamically update a finite subset of hypothesis. We show that sampling actively new tasks, as well as selecting actively the next visited states, significantly improves the final performance of our method.

In section~\ref{chapter:limitations:framehypothesis}, we release the assumption that the interaction frame is known and consider the agent has access to a finite number of hypothetic interaction frames. We illustrated this problem in a simple line world scenario. We present results from simulated experiments that demonstrate the ability of our method to not only learn the task and the signal to meaning mapping, but also the interaction protocol used by the teacher.

In section~\ref{chapter:limitations:proof}, we propose a minimalist proof for our algorithm. We spotlight the importance of understanding the properties of our algorithm, and to be able to have some certitude about its convergence and accuracy properties.

\section{Discussion}
\label{chapter:limitations:discussion}

We reviewed an extensive number of limitations and proposed a number of possible extensions addressing them. The main extensions address the problems of continuous state space, continuous task hypothesis space and unspecified interaction frames. Our results make us envision the use of our algorithm in more complex scenarios more suited to real world robotics applications.
