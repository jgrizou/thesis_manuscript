\chapter{Planning upon Uncertainty}
\label{chapter:planning}
\minitoc

Context - Why now: we shown that we can solve the problem but did not considered the problem of planning

Need - Why the reader: the planning has been shown to be an important aspect of most online real world learning system, 

Task - Why me: we investigated the problem of uncertainty in our problem

Object- Why this chapter: We start by providing an intuition on what are the sources of uncertainty inherent to our problem. Describe a metric that is able to measure it and show on simulated experiment that this method is more efficient than several standard ones.

Findings - What: We identified two sources of uncertainty in for our problem and combined them into one efficient metrics that reduce to other method if the mapping between signal and meaning was known

Conclusions - So what: We can improve the learning efficiency of such a system that become aware of the information it misses or it miss model and can actively try to recover from this.

Perspectives - What now: how does it apply to a real word complex scenario. actually useful for some person that can't use button and where signal are never the same, where some universal classifier does no exist.
